**Hello World! 🌍**

My name is Richa. I am a software developer and self-taught programmer with over five years of experience. I am originally from Delhi and discovered my interest in technology while studying Business Administration. This combination of business knowledge and technical skills led me to move to Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of India, to learn more about software engineering. I have built a strong base in business and technology and gained experience in programming, web development, data analysis, and project management. I have worked on a range of projects that helped me improve my skills and solve different challenges.

I recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science at the Creative Computing Institute, University of the Arts London, graduating with distinction for my dissertation.

Through this blog, I will share my experiences, insights, and thoughts on the connection between technology, business, and data. Whether you are a developer, a tech enthusiast, or someone curious about the tech world, I invite you to join me as we explore and learn together.
