Hello World!	

My name is Richa, and I am a budding web developer and self-taught programmer with over four years of experience in the field. Originally from Delhi, I discovered my passion for tech while studying business administration and decided to pursue it further by moving to Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of India. As a software engineer, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and develop my skills in programming, web development, and software design. 

Through this blog, I hope to share my experiences, insights, and thoughts on all things tech-related. Whether you're a fellow developer, a tech enthusiast, or simply curious about the world of technology, I invite you to join me on this journey as we explore the exciting and ever-changing world of tech together.
