Hello World! :grin:	 :grin:	

I am Richa, budding web-developer and self-taught programmer. I grew up in Delhi and "studied" Business Administration. Lately I realized my heart (:heart:) lies in tech and building stuff. So I packed my bags and arrived in Bangalore, silicon valley of India :smiley:.
