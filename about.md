Hello World! 

I am Richa, budding web-developer and self-taught programmer. I grew up in Delhi and "studied" Business Administration. Lately I realized my heart (<3) lies in tech and building stuff. So I packed my bags and arrived in Bangalore, silicon valley of India :-). 

Here I have been spending time at [Jaaga Study](https://www.jaaga.in/study) to learn stuff and break things.
