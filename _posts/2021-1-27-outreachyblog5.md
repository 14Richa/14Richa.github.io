Now that the Outreachy internship is about to end, it is time to set new goals and decide what to do next. This experience has been challenging, empowering  and much richer than I could have thought.

#### What do I want to do now, once this wonderful experience is over?

I want to find a full-time remote job as a full-stack developer. I know full stack roles combine both the major roles required to develop an app; the front-end and the backend. 
In simple words, I  want to become a successful developer with a deep understanding of what I do and I want my command of technologies to be really good. I want to know deeply, in order to stand out in the market.
Besides this, I want to keep learning and improving my technical skills.

(And if Iâ€™m not ready for a full-time position yet, hopefully I am still good for another internship. Or a contract, a part-time job. As long as I am able to keep learning and getting better. So I can help others learn and get better, too.)


After 5 years , I wish to be an outstanding developer who is living the life she has always dreamt of, and I hope that this internship leads me to the first step!
