title:  "Breaking into GSoC 2023 with Postman"

When I found out about Google Summer of Code, I knew immediately that it was something I wanted to participate in. GSoC is a program that offers contributors the opportunity to work on open source software projects, while getting paid a stipend to do so. It's a win-win situation for all involved - contributors get to gain valuable experience and skills, while open source projects benefit from the contributions of eager young minds.

In this blog post, I want to share the steps I followed during the application period that helped me get selected for Google Summer of Code 2023 with Postman and AsyncAPI. As a developer interested in API development and open-source software, this is an incredible opportunity to gain real-world experience and contribute to exciting projects.

I am delighted to have been selected for this program, and I am excited to share my journey with you all.

## Finding the Right Project

Choosing the right project is crucial for a successful GSoC experience. For me, it was essential to select a project that aligned with my interests and skills while also challenging me to learn new things. I spent a considerable amount of time researching and analyzing various project proposals before finally zeroing in on a project that seemed like the perfect fit.

I was thrilled to see Postman and AsyncAPI participating in GSoC 2023 when the organizations were announced on February 22, 2023, at 11:30 PM IST because I had been following them for some time. After going through the list of projects they were offering, I found one that particularly caught my attention. The project involved automating the listing of members of the technical steering committee (TSC) on the AsyncAPI website.

The AsyncAPI community follows an open governance model and has introduced a TSC comprising all the code owners who wish to exercise their right to have a say in the TSC's decision-making process. The goal of this project is to develop a GitHub action or bot that can read VOTERS files from all AsyncAPI repositories, maintain a single list, and display it on the website.


## Involving in the Community, Getting in Touch with Mentors, and Getting Familiar with the Code Base

After finding the right project, I immediately started getting involved in the AsyncAPI community. I introduced myself to the mentors, Lukasz Gornicki and Khuda Dad Nomani, and other community members and started attending webinars and meetups. This helped me gain a better understanding of the organization and the project's goals.

I also began familiarizing myself with the code base and documentation to better understand the project's development process and how my proposed project fits into those goals. As I got more comfortable with the code base, I started contributing by raising pull requests for small issues. I was delighted when a couple of my pull requests got merged, and I was added as a contributor to one of the repositories. The feeling of seeing my contributions being accepted and recognized was indescribable.

Additionally, my mentors assigned me to review some pull requests, which helped me understand how to review others' code and provide constructive feedback. This experience provided me with a better understanding of how to work collaboratively with other contributors and helped me improve my coding skills.

During this time, I also started working on refining my project proposal. I developed a plan for how to approach the project and the solution I had in mind. I reached out to my mentors for feedback, which helped me improve my proposal and prepare for the coding period.

Overall, being involved in the community, contributing to the project, and getting familiar with the code base were crucial steps in preparing for the project. It helped me understand the organization's goals and how I could contribute to the project. I am grateful for the guidance and support of my mentors, Lukasz Gornicki and Khuda Dad Nomani.

After dedicating a significant amount of time to understanding the project requirements, I was able to prepare a well-rounded [proposal for GSoC 2023](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-GJyBY1kngus4ljqAn_N7A3loPPdvl9sXty7kh7spAI/edit?usp=sharing).

## The Moment of Truth

After submitting my application, I had to wait for what felt like a long time to hear back. The results for GSoC 2023 were finally announced on May 4, 2023, at 11:30 PM IST, and I did get the good news that I had been selected. It was a moment of pure joy; I remember jumping up and down in my room, feeling like I had achieved something truly special. After putting in weeks of hard work and preparation, the news was nerve-wracking, but the feeling of being chosen made it all worth it.

I immediately reached out to my mentors, Lukasz Gornicki and Khuda Dad Nomani, to express my gratitude, and they were incredibly supportive and congratulatory. I'm honored to have the opportunity to work with the Postman and AsyncAPI community and contribute to this open-source project that I'm passionate about. This experience is a dream come true for me, and I'm eager to see what the future holds.

## The Community Bonding Period

After being selected for the Postman and AsyncAPI GSoC 2023 project, I eagerly jumped into the community bonding period. This period is designed to help contributors get to know their mentors, other contributors, and the project's codebase and development process.

During this period, I attended community events such as webinars and meetups, and engaged with other contributors on the project's communication channels. This allowed me to get to know the other contributors and learn more about their experiences and perspectives. It was inspiring to see the passion and dedication that everyone brought to the project.

On May 18, I had my first Zoom meeting with my mentors, Lukasz Gornicki, Khuda Dad Nomani, and Saurav Kumar. During the meeting, we discussed the project's goals and how my proposed solution fits into them. They provided valuable feedback and guidance, and we decided how we will communicate going forward. We will have weekly sync calls where we will discuss the agenda and progress of the project. Their guidance and support have left me feeling even more excited and motivated to contribute to the project.

In addition to community engagement, I have been spending time getting more familiar with the project's codebase and documentation. This involved reading through the code, experimenting with it, and asking questions when I needed help. This process helped me gain a deeper understanding of the project's goals and how my proposed project fits into them.

As the community bonding period comes to a close, I am excited to begin the actual coding period on May 29. I feel well-prepared thanks to the community bonding period and my mentors' guidance, and I am eager to start contributing to the project in a more concrete way.

I was elated to discover that I had been featured in the Postman blog as one of the accepted contributors for GSoC 2023 with Postman and AsyncAPI. It was an honor to be recognized among such a talented group of individuals.
