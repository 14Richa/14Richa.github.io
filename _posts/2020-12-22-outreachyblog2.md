## Everybody struggles

#### Stop focusing on results and enjoy the process.

I haven’t had many difficulties in coding on my project yet. Maybe because I already have some experience with the languages I’m using currently for my Mozilla Container Project. However, there are many new methods and platforms I am using during the outreachy internship. Every time my mentor suggests new methods, I spend a lot of time studying them from their documentation. So I am spending time learning phabricator, mercurial and searchfox. 
As I work on larger projects in my internships, I have come to realize that knowing your tools is as important as knowing your programming languages. Tools like searchfox, mercurial, etc. make it easy to collaborate and find the way around in code.

I am also learning how to write good meeting notes during weekly catch-ups. My mentors write down weekly notes which are very helpful throughout the week. This keeps the work organized and on-track. 

The good side of all the struggle and hard work is that we learn and get out of our comfort zone. It may sound overwhelming or scary at first, but I know deep down trying and discovering new things will eventually be worth it.
At my low points during the internship, I always tell myself that even the most experienced person felt and went through the same fight like us, although I am still a beginner at some topics, the main purpose of this internship is to learn and improve each day.
