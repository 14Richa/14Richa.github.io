"Currying is the process of turning a function with multiple arity into a function with less arity"  — Kristina Brainwave

Currying is a method in programming in which we can transform a function with multiple arguments into a nested functions. It returns a new function that expects the next argument.

So, currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a series of functions each taking a single argument.

Let’s look at a simple example:

{% highlight js %}

  function multiply(a, b, c) { return a * b * c;}

{% endhighlight %}

This function takes three numbers, multiplies the numbers and returns the result.

{% highlight js %}

  multiply(1,2,3); // 6

{% endhighlight %}

Let’s create a curried version of the same  function and see how we would call the same function and get the same result :

{% highlight js %}

    function multiply(a) {    
        return (b) => {        
            return (c) => {            
                return a * b * c        
                }    
            }
    } 
    
    multiply(1)(2)(3) // 6

    {% endhighlight %}

Above as you can see we have turned the multiply(1,2,3) function call to multiply(1)(2)(3) multiple function calls.

#### Is Currying useful?

 **Avoid frequently calling a function with the same argument**:

For example, we have a function to calculate the volume of a cylinder:

{% highlight js %}

    function volume(l, w, h) {    return l * w * h;}

{% endhighlight %}

It happens that all the cylinders are of height 100m.
You will see that you will repeatedly call this function with `h` as `100`:

{% highlight js %}

    volume(200,30,100) // 20030100
    volume(32,45,100); //144000l

{% endhighlight %}
    

To resolve this, you curry the `volume` function(like we did earlier):

{% highlight js %}

    function volume(h) {    
        return (w) => {        
            return (l) => {            
                return (l * w * h)        
            }    
        }
     }
    

{% endhighlight %}

We can define a specific function for a particular cylinder height:

{% highlight js %}

    const CylinderHeight = volume(100);
    CylinderHeight(200)(30); // 600,000l

{% endhighlight %}


#### Conclusion 

Currying is a transform that makes `function(a,b,c)`  as `function(a)(b)(c)`. 

Currying allows to easily get partials function. As we’ve seen in the volume example: the universal `function log(h, w, l)` after currying gives us partials when called with one argument like `function(h)` or two arguments `function(w, l)`.
