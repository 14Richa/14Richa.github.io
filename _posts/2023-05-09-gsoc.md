As a software developer, I've always been passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact on the world. That's why I was thrilled to be accepted into the Outreachy program in 2020, which provides internships for people from underrepresented backgrounds to work on open-source projects. During my time with Outreachy, I worked with a fantastic team at Mozilla on a project that helped me develop my skills and make valuable contributions to the open-source community.

However, I didn't stop there. I knew that I wanted to continue my open-source journey and take on even bigger challenges. That's why I set my sights on the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, which provides even more opportunities for developers to work on open-source projects with mentorship and support from top organizations.

After months of hard work and preparation, I was thrilled to receive the news that I had been accepted into the GSoC 2023 program with Postman and AsyncAPI. This was a dream come true for me, and a testament to the hard work and dedication that I had put into my open-source contributions.

In my GSoC role, I'll be working on developing new features and improving performance for Postman's API development platform, as well as contributing to the development of AsyncAPI's open-source specification for event-driven APIs. This is an exciting opportunity for me to continue learning and growing as a developer, while also making real contributions to the open-source community.

Looking back on my journey from Outreachy with Mozilla to GSoC, I'm proud of the hard work and dedication that I've put into my open-source work. These programs have not only helped me develop my technical skills but also connect with a community of like-minded individuals who share my passion for using technology to make the world a better place. I'm grateful to both Outreachy and GSoC for providing me with the opportunity to develop my skills and make valuable contributions to the community, and I'm excited to see where my open-source journey takes me next.

In summary, my journey from Outreachy with Mozilla to GSoC has been one of hard work, dedication, and a commitment to using my skills to make a positive impact on the world. I'm excited to continue this journey and see where it takes me, and I encourage other developers to consider getting involved in open-source projects as well.
