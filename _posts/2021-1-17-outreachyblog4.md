## Halfway to the internship’s progress report 

I’m so glad that I’ve successfully completed my week 7-8 on Outreachy. It was an awesome journey till now along with my mentors. Actually, Outreachy is a great community offering internships to underrepresented groups all around the world by working remotely and I love such platforms so much. It really encourages me to contribute to open source with freedom and to gain more knowledge.

My project involves improving Firefox to give users more control over add-ons in Container tabs. As we know Firefox Containers are a way for users to isolate their online identities and tasks from one another.

So, currently, I am working on Tabs API and writing unit tests for the same. Tabs API is a wide API that will cover most of the extensions.  I think after completing Tabs API successfully it would be easy for me to understand and get familiar with the code base of the rest of the API. And I can therefore speed up my work. 

Currently, I am writing unit tests which are new to me. So, it is taking time but with the help of my mentors I know I will be able to do the same by the end of this week. And then start with the rest of the API’s.

At last, again I’d like to thank outreachy and Mozilla team for giving me the opportunity for such a great journey
