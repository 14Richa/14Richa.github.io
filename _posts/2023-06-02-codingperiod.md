I am excited to share my experiences during my first week in GSoC 2023 with Postman and Async API. I started my coding period on May 29th, 2023, and I am thrilled to be a part of this amazing community.

During my first week, I used Mermaid to create flowcharts for the project. Mermaid is a powerful tool that offers a range of benefits for developers, including its simple and intuitive syntax, wide range of diagram types, easy integration with Markdown, customizable styling, and real-time updates. I found it to be an excellent choice for creating visual representations of my code.

I also raised a pull request (PR) for the flowchart, which was a great learning experience. You can find the PR here: https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/719.

In addition to the flowchart, I also contributed to the project by creating two workflows. The first workflow was to welcome new contributors, which got merged into the project. You can find the PR for this workflow [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pull/717). It was a great feeling to contribute something that would help other developers get started with the project.

The second workflow was of checking YAMLint of YAML files once a PR is raised. This workflow was necessary to ensure that the YAML files were formatted correctly and followed the project's standards. You can find the PR for this workflow [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/pull/238). The workflow helped to save time and made the review process more efficient.

In addition to the workflows, I also raised a PR that migrates JSON to YAML and updated the website code to support YAML format. This was a significant accomplishment as it allowed for a smoother transition to YAML format and improved the user experience. You can find the PR for this contribution [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/pull/1722).

Overall, my first week in GSoC 2023 with Postman and Async APIwas an incredible learning experience. I had the opportunity to work with an amazing team of developers, and I learned a lot about open-source development, communication, and project management.

I am excited to continue contributing to the project and to explore new technologies and tools. My first week has given me a sense of confidence and motivation to continue learning and growing as a developer.

I would like to thank Postman and Async API for giving me this opportunity and for providing me with the necessary resources and support to succeed. I am grateful for the experience, and I look forward to what the future holds.

In conclusion, if you are a developer looking to get involved with open-source projects, I highly recommend participating in programs like GSoC. It is an excellent way to gain real-world experience, collaborate with other developers, and contribute to projects that make a difference in the world.
